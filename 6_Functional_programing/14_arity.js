// Arity - number of arguments function takes

// Arity of 1
function person(name){

}

// Arity of 3
function boss(name, level, location){

}

// In functional programming usually functions with lower arity are better.
// It is better to have more smaller functions with smaller arity as it is easier to apply concepts like curying, partial application, compose or pipe
