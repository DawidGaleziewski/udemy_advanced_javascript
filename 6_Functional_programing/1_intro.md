 # Functional programming
 Functional programming is nothing new. It existed for the last 60 years

 Origin of functional programming comes from mathematics and lambda calculus

 Functional programming is great for distributed systems, where there are multiple machines interacting with data

 ## Separation of concerns
 Packeging our code in seperate chunks so everything is well oganised

 Each part of code is concentrated on one thing it is good at.
 Unlike OOP, functional programing also pushes to separate data and functions

 There is a data and it gets interacted with by functions. But we wont merge functions and data

 functional programming focuses on simplicity

 Functional programming does not use classes or methods

 Functions operate on well defined data structures like objects and arrays but this data does not belong to those functions

 ## Goals of functional programming are the same as in OOP
 - Clear + understandable
 - Easy to extend
 - Easy to Maintain
 - Memory Efficient
 - DRY

 Unlike OOP in FP all boils to the concept of "PURE FUNCTIONS" this is the main pilar of FP

 - PURE FUNCTION - separation of the data of the program and it behaviour. All objects created in FP should be UNMUTABLE. We avoid share state. Once object is created it CANNOT be changed
